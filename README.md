# 🧹 Data Preprocessing 

This repository showcases **data preprocessing techniques** applied to different datasets.  
It highlights skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning and deep learning models.

## 📂 Contents
1. **License Plate Preprocessing** (`notebooks/license_plate_preprocessing.ipynb`)  
   - Dataset: Algerian vehicle license plate images (private dataset)  
   - Steps:
     - Image resizing & grayscale conversion
     - Histogram equalization
     - Thresholding & edge detection
     - Bounding box extraction
   - Tools: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib  
   - Example:  

   | Original | Preprocessed |
   |----------|--------------|
   | ![Before](images/sample_before.png) | ![After](images/sample_after.png) |

2. **Other Preprocessing Project** (`notebooks/other_preprocessing.ipynb`)  
   - (Add a short description once you give me the second notebook)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- OpenCV  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend preprocessing for text and tabular datasets  
- Apply to deep learning pipelines (CNN preprocessing)  
- Combine with ML models for end-to-end workflows

## 🔒 Notes
- Datasets are **not included** due to size/licensing.  
- This repo contains only code, notebooks, and example outputs.
